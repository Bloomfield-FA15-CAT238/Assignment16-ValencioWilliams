How to make a basic 2D platformer:

Although, the person did not finish their tutorial series, this tutorial teaches people how to make a basic 2D platformer. She types the script and thoroughly explains each segment of code and what it does to unity. The tutorial also gives tips on how to allow double single jumping and other basic movements in 2D. She also uses the physics 2D component which was not mentioned in class. 

I chose this tutorial because I was expecting her to go through the steps to making a full platformer game. I found it when I was looking up youtube videos for assignment15. However, I didn't realize at the time she stopped making videos for this series and continued making other things. Its good practice for people who are still beginners in unity and its fairly easy to understand.
